"""This class is used if the player picks gamemode (1). 
It should roll the dice by itself.
It should have 2 difficulty levels, one normal and one hard.

Add AI decision making, if there is time. 
Ex. if the computer manages to collect enough points, it should stop rolling.

Possibility of having the harder difficulty AI be more risk-averse.
Stopping it's turn faster than it's normal counterpart.
